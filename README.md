## Introduction
Vue Router is a routing library that allows developers to manage client-side routing in single-page applications (SPAs) built with the Vue.js framework. It enables the creation of dynamic and interactive user interfaces by mapping URLs to specific components. Features include:
  <ul>
    <li>Nested routes mapping</li>
    <li>Dynamic Routing</li>
    <li>Modular, component-based router configuration</li>
    <li>Route params, query, wildcards</li>
    <li>View transition effects powered by Vue.js' transition system</li>
    <li>Fine-grained navigation control</li>
    <li>Links with automatic active CSS classes</li>
    <li>HTML5 history mode or hash mode</li>
    <li>Customizable Scroll Behavior</li>
    <li>Proper encoding for URLs</li>
  </ul>
<p>Vue Router was created by Evan You, the creator of Vue.js, and is currently maintained by the Vue.js team and the open-source community. The Vue.js team is responsible for approving changes to its code and architecture, and the library is developed and maintained as an open-source project.</p>
