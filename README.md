# Vue Router
## Introduction
Vue Router is a routing library that allows developers to manage client-side routing in single-page applications (SPAs) built with the Vue.js framework. It enables the creation of dynamic and interactive user interfaces by mapping URLs to specific components. Features include:
  <ul>
    <li>Nested routes mapping</li>
    <li>Dynamic Routing</li>
    <li>Modular, component-based router configuration</li>
    <li>Route params, query, wildcards</li>
    <li>View transition effects powered by Vue.js' transition system</li>
    <li>Fine-grained navigation control</li>
    <li>Links with automatic active CSS classes</li>
    <li>HTML5 history mode or hash mode</li>
    <li>Customizable Scroll Behavior</li>
    <li>Proper encoding for URLs</li>
  </ul>
<p>Vue Router was created by Evan You, the creator of Vue.js, and is currently maintained by the Vue.js team and the open-source community. The Vue.js team is responsible for approving changes to its code and architecture, and the library is developed and maintained as an open-source project.</p>

### Applied Perspective:
- Client-Server Architecture Perspective:
<p>The client side, which is in charge of the user interface and presentation logic. The two main components of the client-server architecture are the server and data storage, processing, and business logic management. The client and server often utilize HTTP or WebSocket to communicate across a network.</p>

- Relevant Client-Server Architecture Concerns
<ul>
<li> **Scalability** : Consider the system's capacity to scale in order to accommodate growing user traffic and many continuous inquiries. This entails investigating the distributed processing capabilities, caching techniques, and load balancing systems.</li>
<li> **Safety** : Evaluate the system's security procedures in place to guard against unauthorized access, data breaches, and other security risks. Analyzing authentication processes, data encryption, and secure communication protocols may be necessary for this.</li>
<li> **Performance** : Consider the client-server aspect of the vue-router architecture while evaluating performance. To find possible bottlenecks or opportunities for improvement, analyze variables like response times, network latency, and resource use.</li>
<li> **Network Communication** : Consider the client-server interactions and data types used in the vue-router system. This involves investigating any used communication techniques, such as WebSocket connections or RESTful APIs.</li>
<li> **Client-Side Rendering** : Take into account how the vue-router system manages client-side rendering. Analyze the effectiveness of client-side component rendering and how it affects both performance and user experience.</li>
<li> **Data Storage and Management** : Analyze the server-side data storage technologies employed by the system for data management. To guarantee effective data storage and retrieval, examine the data models, database technology, and data management techniques used.</li>
